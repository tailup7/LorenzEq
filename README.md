# Lorenz System

The Lorenz equations are a series of nonlinear ordinary differential equations as shown below.

This equation has chaotic solutions, as shown in the animation below. This “unpredictable” phenomenon is caused by nonlinear term.
After the discovery of this equation, researches of nonlinearities and chaos have begun.

As the figure below shows, chaotic solution has sensitivity to initial conditions. Slight differences in initial values increase the error as time goes on, and the trajectory becomes unpredictable. This property is often used to explain the butterfly effect. On the other hand, chaotic solution has some boundedness. In the figure above, the solution values remain within a certain range.

Navier-Stokes equation, which is the governnig equation of flow field, also have nonliner term, and that's why prediction of flow field is so difficult.
