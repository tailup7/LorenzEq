# Lorenz System

The Lorenz equations are a series of nonlinear ordinary differential equations as shown below.

This equation has chaotic solutions for specific parameter values(σ, ρ) and initial conditions, and is often used to explain the so-called butterfly effect. 
After the discovery of this equation, researches of nonlinearities and chaos have begun. <br>

Navier-Stokes equation, which is the governnig equation of flow field, also have nonliner term, and that's why prediction of flow field is so difficult.
